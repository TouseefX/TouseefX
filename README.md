# About and How It Works Roblox-LinuxInstaller Script
The given code snippet is a Bash script that contains a function named "downloader" and a main function named "full_setup". The purpose of the script is to set up and install the necessary dependencies for running Roblox on a Linux system.

The "downloader" function is responsible for downloading a file from a given URL and verifying its integrity by comparing its MD5 checksum. It attempts to download the file up to 5 times, and if it fails, it displays an error message and exits the script.

The "full_setup" function is the main function that performs the complete setup process. It checks for missing dependencies, such as "lib32-gnutls", "lib32-alsa-plugins", "lib32-libpulse", "lib32-openal", "xdg-utils", "git", "wget", and "wine". If any of these dependencies are missing, the script attempts to install them using the appropriate package manager based on the detected Linux distribution.

The function also removes any existing Roblox launchers and adds a custom launcher to the xdg list. It then sets up a custom directory for Wine and downloads and extracts a custom version of Wine if it is not already present.

Next, the script checks if Roblox is already installed by checking for the existence of the "RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe" file. If it is not found, the script downloads the Roblox player launcher and launches the setup process using Wine. After the setup is completed, the script removes unnecessary desktop entries and sets up a custom desktop entry for the Roblox player.

The script prompts the user for their preferred graphics API, such as Vulkan, OpenGL, or DirectX11. It also asks if the user wants to enable options to boost FPS, install Vulkan, and unlock FPS. Based on the user's responses, the script updates the "ClientAppSettings.json" file with the chosen options.

Finally, the script gives the option to install or uninstall DXVK, a set of libraries that provide support for DirectX in Wine. If the user chooses to install DXVK, the script downloads and runs the DXVK setup script.

Once the setup is complete, the script informs the user and returns to the main menu.


# About Minecraft Linux Installer
The given code snippet is a bash script that installs and sets up a launcher called SKLauncher for Minecraft on a Linux operating system.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

The script begins by checking if the CPU supports AVX instructions. If it doesn't, a warning message is displayed, informing the user that Minecraft may not work properly.

Next, the script checks if the glibc version is 2.31 or newer. If it is not, an error message is displayed, stating that the system is unsupported, and the script exits.

The function full_setup is defined. This function performs the following tasks:

a. Installs necessary packages like wget, unzip, git, and tar using the package manager specific to the Linux distribution.

b. Creates a directory named .MinecraftInstaller in the user's home directory.

c. Checks if Java 18 is installed. If not, it installs OpenJDK 18.

d. Downloads the SK.jar file, which is the launcher for Minecraft, and saves it in the .MinecraftInstaller directory.

e. Downloads the icon file for SKLauncher and saves it in the .MinecraftInstaller directory.

f. Creates a desktop entry file named SKLauncher.desktop in the .local/share/applications directory, which allows the launcher to be executed from the desktop environment.

g. Makes the SKLauncher.desktop file executable.

h. Displays a success message once the setup is complete.

The main_menu function is defined. This function presents a menu to the user with two options:

a. "Install SKLauncher": This option calls the full_setup function to install and set up SKLauncher for Minecraft.

b. "Exit": This option exits the script.

The script determines the Linux distribution by checking the availability of package managers like apt, yum, zypper, and pacman. If none of them are available, an error message is displayed, and the script aborts.

The main menu is displayed to the user, prompting them to make a selection. The script reads the user's input and executes the corresponding option.

Overall, this script automates the installation and setup process for SKLauncher, providing an easy way for users to launch and play Minecraft on their Linux systems.
