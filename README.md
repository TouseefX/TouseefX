# About and How It Works Roblox-LinuxInstaller Script
The given code snippet is a Bash script that contains a function named "downloader" and a main function named "full_setup". The purpose of the script is to set up and install the necessary dependencies for running Roblox on a Linux system.

The "downloader" function is responsible for downloading a file from a given URL and verifying its integrity by comparing its MD5 checksum. It attempts to download the file up to 5 times, and if it fails, it displays an error message and exits the script.

The "full_setup" function is the main function that performs the complete setup process. It checks for missing dependencies, such as "lib32-gnutls", "lib32-alsa-plugins", "lib32-libpulse", "lib32-openal", "xdg-utils", "git", "wget", and "wine". If any of these dependencies are missing, the script attempts to install them using the appropriate package manager based on the detected Linux distribution.

The function also removes any existing Roblox launchers and adds a custom launcher to the xdg list. It then sets up a custom directory for Wine and downloads and extracts a custom version of Wine if it is not already present.

Next, the script checks if Roblox is already installed by checking for the existence of the "RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe" file. If it is not found, the script downloads the Roblox player launcher and launches the setup process using Wine. After the setup is completed, the script removes unnecessary desktop entries and sets up a custom desktop entry for the Roblox player.

The script prompts the user for their preferred graphics API, such as Vulkan, OpenGL, or DirectX11. It also asks if the user wants to enable options to boost FPS, install Vulkan, and unlock FPS. Based on the user's responses, the script updates the "ClientAppSettings.json" file with the chosen options.

Finally, the script gives the option to install or uninstall DXVK, a set of libraries that provide support for DirectX in Wine. If the user chooses to install DXVK, the script downloads and runs the DXVK setup script.

Once the setup is complete, the script informs the user and returns to the main menu.
